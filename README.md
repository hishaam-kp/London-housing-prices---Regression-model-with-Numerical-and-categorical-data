<h1>🏡 London House Price Prediction – Capstone Project <br>
Overview </h1>

This project analyzes London’s 2018 housing market data to uncover the key drivers of property prices. Using regression modeling, I built a predictive model to estimate house prices based on demographic, financial, and property-related features. The goal is to provide insights into what factors most influence housing affordability and to demonstrate applied data science skills.

<h1>📊 Dataset </h1>
Source: London House Price dataset (2018)

Features include:

Property attributes (size, type, location)

Financial details (price, mortgage, interest rates)

Demographics and regional indicators

Target Variable: House Price

<h1>🧪 Project Steps </h1>

<h4>1. Exploratory Data Analysis</h4>
Loaded CSV data into Pandas

Summary statistics of house prices across regions

Visualizations: histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps

Identified key variables correlated with house prices (e.g., property size, location index)

<h4>2. Modeling</h4>
🔹 Simple Linear Regression
Predictor: Property size vs. house price

Result: Weak explanatory power (low R²)

🔹 Multiple Linear Regression
Predictors: Property size, region, mortgage rate, income indicators

Result: Stronger model fit with improved R²

Checked statistical significance (p-values < 0.05)

<h4>4. Model Evaluation</h4>
Highlighted variables with the greatest impact on pricing

<h2>📈 Key Insights</h2>
Location (region) is the strongest driver of house price variation

Property size and income indicators also significantly influence affordability

Mortgage and interest rates play a secondary but notable role

<h2>🛠️ Tech Stack</h2>
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Regression modeling and visualization

<h2>🚀 How to Run</h2>
Download the dataset

Clone this repository

Open the notebook (London_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb) in Jupyter

Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and model
